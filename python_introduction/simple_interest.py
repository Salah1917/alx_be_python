# principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
# rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
# time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
# Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
# Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].
# Expected Output:

# When executed, your script should print the simple interest calculated with the provided values. For principal = 1000, rate = 0.05, and time = 3, the output should be:

# The simple interest is: 150.0


principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3
interest = principal * rate * time 
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
